***** IMPORTANT *****
This is an early release for testing purposes. 
Please provide feedback and feature requests!

N.B. This is an alpha release which means that the API _may_ still change (slightly). 
This release is _not_ for everyday use, it is meant for testing _only_. 
You have been warned ;-)

* How to use AquaTerm:
AquaTerm is a graphics viewer that can be used to easily add aqua graphics to (primarily scientific) legacy applications written in C, FORTRAN or any other language that can call C or Objective-C library functions.

AquaTerm.app register with the system and responds to a (small) set of remote messages. The connection between the client and the server (AquaTerm.app) is handled by a shared lib (libaquaterm.dylib). The library exposes small and simple C and Objective-C interfaces (use either according to taste) which is tailored to suit procedural code. See AQTAdapter.h and aquaterm.h for details.     

* Documentation

The API is detailed in AQTAdapter.html which is generated from AQTAdapter.h using AutoDoc.
Full documentation is available at http://aquaterm.sourceforge.net
