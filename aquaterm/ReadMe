* How to use AquaTerm
AquaTerm is a graphics viewer that can be used to easily add aqua graphics to (primarily scientific) legacy applications written in C, FORTRAN or any other language that can call C or Objective-C library functions.

AquaTerm.app register with the system and responds to a (small) set of remote messages. The connection between the client and the server (AquaTerm.app) is handled by a shared lib (libaquaterm.dylib). The library exposes small and simple C and Objective-C interfaces (use either according to taste) which is tailored to suit procedural code. See AQTAdapter.h and aquaterm.h for details.     

* Documentation
The Objctive-C API is detailed in AQTAdapter.html which is generated from AQTAdapter.h using AutoDoc.
The only documentation for the C API is aquaterm.h together with AQTAdapter.html.
More documentation is, or will be, available at http://aquaterm.sourceforge.net
