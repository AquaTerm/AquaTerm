The docs that used to live here has moved!

All docs are available from http://aquaterm.github.net


Obsolete:

Class docs used to be created on the fly by selecting target Docs in PB and clicking build.
They can be found in directory aquaterm/build/docs.

Note. You need autodoc (used to be on http://softrak.stepwise.com/category?os=20&cat=3184, but the link is broken now) and you will have to change the path to makedocs script in PB buid settings.
