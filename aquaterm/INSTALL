To install at default locations:
1) Drag AquaTerm.app to /Applications
2) Copy libaquaterm.1.0.0.dylib (in ./lib) to /usr/local/lib/ 
3) Create a link libaquaterm.dylib -> libaquaterm.1.0.0.dylib
4) Copy the contents of ./include to /usr/local/include

This is the result:

/usr/local/
	include/aquaterm/
		aquaterm.h
		AQTAdapter.h
	lib/
		libaquaterm.1.0.0.dylib
		libaquaterm.dylib -> libaquaterm.1.0.0.dylib
