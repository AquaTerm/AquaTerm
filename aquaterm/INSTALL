To install at default locations:
1) Drag AquaTerm.app to /Applications
2) Copy libaquaterm.1.0.0.dylib (in ./lib) to /usr/local/lib/ 
3) Create a link libaquaterm.dylib -> libaquaterm.1.0.0.dylib using the command 
sudo ln -s /usr/local/lib/libaquaterm.1.0.0.dylib /usr/local/lib/libaquaterm.dylib
4) Copy the contents of ./include to /usr/local/include/aquaterm

This is the result:
---
/usr/local/
    include/aquaterm/
        aquaterm.h
        AQTAdapter.h
    lib/
        libaquaterm.1.0.0.dylib
        libaquaterm.dylib -> libaquaterm.1.0.0.dylib

Run the makefiles in C/ and fortran/
