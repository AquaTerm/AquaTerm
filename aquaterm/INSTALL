If you are building from source, perform the following steps to install AquaTerm after building.

To install at default locations:
1) Drag AquaTerm.app to /Applications
2) Drag AquaTerm.framework to /Library/Frameworks
3) Then, for backwards compatibility, symlinks should be placed from /usr/local/lib/libaquaterm.dylib 
to the executable inside the framework, and similar for the headers. Given that the framework is in 
/Library/Frameworks the following needs to be done:

ln -s /Library/Frameworks/AquaTerm.framework/Versions/A/AquaTerm /usr/local/lib/libaquaterm.dylib
ln -s /Library/Frameworks/AquaTerm.framework/Versions/A/AquaTerm /usr/local/lib/libaquaterm.1.0.0.dylib
ln -s /Library/Frameworks/AquaTerm.framework/Versions/A/Headers/* /usr/local/include/aquaterm/.

This is the result:
---
/Applications
    AquaTerm.app
/Library/Frameworks/AquaTerm.framework
/usr/local/
    include/aquaterm/
        aquaterm.h -> /Library/...../aquaterm.h
        AQTAdapter.h -> /Library/...../AQTAdapter.h
    lib/
        libaquaterm.1.0.0.dylib -> /Library/...../A/AquaTerm
        libaquaterm.dylib -> /Library/...../A/AquaTerm
===
Run the makefiles in C/ and fortran/
The executables ./demo should produce the same result as menu option Debug->Testview in AquaTerm

Full source in ./aquaterm/
Public API in AQTAdapter.h and aquaterm.h.

Documentation for AQTAdapter on http://aquaterm.sourceforge.net

The following environment variables may be of interest:
---
AQUATERM_LOGLEVEL       set in the range 0-4 to have increasing levels of logging, zero means no logging. 
AQUATERM_PATH           point to any non-standard location of AquaTerm.app e.g. /Users/you/Apps/AquaTerm.app
GNUTERM                 set to "aqua" to make AquaTerm default output in Gnuplot
PGPLOT_DEV              set to "/AQT" to make AquaTerm default output in PGPLOT
