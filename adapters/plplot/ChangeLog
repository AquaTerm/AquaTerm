	* aqtplplot.h, aqtplplot.m, plplot531.patch, ReleaseNotes: PLplot
	  driver lives in PLplot sources nowadays.

2005-07-25 13:02  persquare

	* ReadMe: Reinstating file.

2005-07-25 12:56  persquare

	* Readme: Removing blocking file.

2005-07-25 12:52  persquare

	* ReadMe: Removing blocking file.

2005-05-01 02:09  hbabcock

	* Readme: Updated plplot readme to reflect the fact that the driver
	  is now part of the plplot project

2005-01-18 03:45  hbabcock

	* aqtplplot.m: cleaned up mouse event handling somewhat

2005-01-16 02:46  hbabcock

	* aqtplplot.m: Added basic mouse event handling functionality to
	  the adapter. The user can now click on the plot and the position
	  of the click will be returned to PLplot

2005-01-03 03:37  hbabcock

	* aqtplplot.m: modified driver to support page configuration. i.e.
	  the user can now specify how big the graph size will be (in
	  pixels). tweaked implementation of SCALE so that it is not
	  assumed to be 10 (or 0.1) by other constants in the driver.

2004-11-26 18:02  hbabcock

	* aqtplplot.m: improved implementation of SCALE so that
	  saved/printed Aquaterm plots are not 10x too large

2004-11-26 04:06  hbabcock

	* aqtplplot.m: Scale parameter added back in to take advantage of
	  the higher screen resolution offered by Quartz; example/c/x10c
	  works properly with this change

2004-11-22 03:00  hbabcock

	* aqtplplot.m: modified proc_str to improve text placement

2004-11-22 01:40  hbabcock

	* aqtplplot.m: cleaned up so more debris associated with color
	  handling

2004-11-22 00:56  hbabcock

	* aqtplplot.m: changed set_color to use the current plot color
	  _directly_ rather then pulling it from the color table

2004-11-22 00:43  hbabcock

	* aqtplplot.m: removed unused .h files; removed scale factor so
	  that plplot/example/c/x10c works properly

2004-11-21 23:05  persquare

	* aqtplplot.m: Fixing some debris from the new color handling code.

2004-11-21 22:43  hbabcock

	* ReadMe, Readme, plplot531.patch: Added plplot installation
	  instructions and the plplot531.patch

2004-11-21 02:35  hbabcock

	* aqtplplot.m: Changed how aqtplplot.m handles color; It now
	  accesses the current color table(s) kept by plplot rather then
	  using saved copies of its own; A new function called set_color
	  was added to implement this

2004-11-21 00:06  hbabcock

	* aqtplplot.m: divides coordinates in moveToVertexPoint and
	  addEdgeToVertexPoint by SCALE; proc_str and esc_purge
	  declarations added
