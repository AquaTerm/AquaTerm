You should be able to get plplot-5.3.1 up and running using:

GNU automake 1.8.5
GNU Autoconf 2.59
GNU libtool 1.5.10
 
In the top plplot directory issue the following commands :
----
patch -p1 < path/to/plplot531.patch
 
cp path/to/aqtplplot.{h,m} drivers/aqt.{h,c}
 
cf/bootstrap
 
./configure --enable-aqt --disable-dyndrivers --disable-f77 
--disable-python --disable-java --disable-static --disable-cxx 
--disable-octave
 
make LIBS="-Wl,-framework -Wl,Foundation"
 
make check

make install
----
Examples :

You can check that things are working correctly by running the demos in /examples/c. Example x21c requires Qhull (www.qhull.org) to generate some of its plots. Qhull needs to be installed prior to configuring & compiling plplot.

----
Notes :
 
The libtool bug (feature?) to drop unknown linker flags is worked 
around by adding the flags as extra libraries (1st make statement 
above).
 
The strictly necessary part of configure is:
./configure --enable-aqt --disable-dyndrivers
