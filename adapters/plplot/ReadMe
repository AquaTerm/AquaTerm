PLPlot has not been updated for this release and may not be compatible with the current PLPlot 5.3.x series.
The adapter has been updated to confirm to AquaTerm 1.x requirements and tested with AquaTerm 1.0.a1 and PLPlot 5.1.

If you use PLPlot, please consider contributing to the effort by patching this adapter as needed.
