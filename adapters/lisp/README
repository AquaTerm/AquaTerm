This module provides a lisp wrapper for the AquaTerm Graphics Terminal. It uses
UFFI, which should hopefully make it portable to most flavors of Lisp. However,
it has only been tested with SBCL 0.9.5.

Hazen 2/06

Installation (SBCL):
1) Install AquaTerm.
2) cd to adapters/lisp directory.
3) make a directory called cl-aqt-0.0.1
4) copy cl-aqt.lisp and cl-aqt.asd into this directory
5) tar together the files in the cl-aqt-0.0.1 directory:
	tar -cvf cl-aqt.tar cl-aqt-0.0.1/*
6) gzip the tar file:
	gzip cl-aqt.tar
7) start your lisp implementation
8) load asdf-install:
   	(require :asdf-install)
9) install cl-aqt:
	(asdf-install:install "cl-aqt.tar.gz")

You now should be able to load this package with (require :cl-aqt)

Notes:
1. In general the AquaTerm library function name is mapped to the lisp 
wrapper function name as for example "aquaInit" -> "aqua-init", and all
functions except for "aqtSetEventHandler" are available.

2. Many of the functions need to be passed variables of the appropriate type 
(float, fixnum, unsigned-byte). This is probably the first thing to check if
you have trouble with a function once you get the package installed.

3. There are some simple test functions that are tacked onto the end of the
package, which should provide some idea of how to use the package.

4. The macro with-aqt-plot wraps plotting inside of calls to set-up and close
a plot (see for example the test-bmp function).
