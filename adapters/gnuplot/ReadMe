Grab gnuplot3.8k tarball

Copy and rename the new gnuplot adapter to term/aquaterm.trm (NB. no upper case 'T')

edit configure manually. Look for the line
LIBS="$LIBS -framework Foundation -framework AppKit" and replace it by
LIBS="$LIBS -laquaterm -framework Foundation"

If you plan on running long sessions with gnuplot, you also want to apply the patch gnuplot_command_c.patch to gnuplot's command.c file.

./configure
make
make install
