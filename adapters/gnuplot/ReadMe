The adapter aquaterm.trm is now distributed as part of gnuplot version 4 and to avoid confusion, it is not distributed as part of AquaTerm anymore.

Get gnuplot from http://gnuplot.sourceforge.net

Make sure yuo install AquaTerm first and then follow the normal instructions for compiling gnuplot 4.x.x, which are:  
./configure
make
make install
