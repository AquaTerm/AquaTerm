With PyObjC <http://pyobjc.sourceforge.net> you can use AquaTerm directly from Python.
All features are exposed via BridgeSupport.

Run the demo files with:
python demo_bridgesupport.py
python demo.py -- obsolete if BridgeSupport is available (10.5)

See documentation for AQTAdapter and PyObjC to find out the syntax.
