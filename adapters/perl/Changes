	- original version; created by h2xs 1.22 with options
		-n Graphics::AquaTerm -x aquaterm/aquaterm

      Sat Jan 22 2005
        - finished touching up files generated by h2xs so that
	    some of the more "complicated" aquaterm functions
	    would also work.
        - added a HOW_TO_USE file to the distribution which is
           basically a text version of what you might someday 
	       see on CPAN

		- updated the driver to support the following new
		   functions that have been added to AquaTerm
		  aqtSetClipRect
