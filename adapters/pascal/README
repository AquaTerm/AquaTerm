This adapter provides a FreePascal wrapper unit for the AquaTerm Graphics Terminal.
All sub-routines listed in aquaterm/aquaterm.h are supported.

To test the Pascal examples, just run the makefile:

  make

then test by

  ./demo
  ./eventdemo1
  ./eventdemo2

The files have been tested with FreePascal, which can be obtained from
www.freepascal.org. They may also work with other Pascal compilers, in
particular GNU Pascal, but this is untested.

Add aquaterm to your "uses" section. You can place aquaterm.pp next to your own
sources, or compile it separately. If fpc cannot find the unit files, you may
have to pass the corresponding path to fpc by the  option "-FuPathToUnit"

If the linker cannot find the AquaTerm library, you may have to pass the
corresponding path from fpc to the linker by the fpc option "-FlPathToLibrary"

The examples are based on the Fortran examples.
